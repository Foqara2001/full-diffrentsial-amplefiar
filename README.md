# full-diffrentsial-amplefiar
This repository contains the design and analysis of four key analog integrated circuits, implemented in CMOS technology:

# Fully Differential Amplifier:
A high-gain, fully differential op-amp with Common-Mode Feedback (CMFB), featuring detailed AC, noise, stability, and settling time analysis.

# Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA):
Design of an OTA with miller compensation, including simulations for gain, phase margin, CMRR, noise, and transient response.

# Low-Power Sensor Amplifier:
A telescopic cascode amplifier optimized for a DC gain of 40 dB and 2 MHz bandwidth while consuming less than 20 μW.

# Wi-Fi 6 Baseband Amplifier:
A wideband amplifier designed for a gain of 20 dB and 20 MHz bandwidth, meeting strict power consumption constraints for Wi-Fi 6 applications.
# 
Each project includes transistor-level design, simulation results (DC, AC, noise, transient), and discussions on design trade-offs.
